    <P>Its a renewable energy source, because the waves flow back from the shore, but they always return. Unlike fossil fuels nor ethanol, which are limited. They require no input from man to make their power, and they can always be counted on. The energy from waves can be taken directly into electricity-producing machinery and used to power generators and power plants nearby making “clean energy”. Which are hard to find these days. Another benefit to using this energy is its nearness to places that can use it. Lots of big cities and harbors are next to the ocean and can harness the power of the waves for their use. About 40 percent of the world’s energy is produced by the “waves”. Coastal cities tend to be well-populated, so lots of people can get use from wave energy plants. A final benefit is that there are a variety of ways to gather it. The biggest advantages of wave power as against most of the other alternative energy sources is that it is easily predictable and can be used to calculate the amount that it can produce. The wave energy is consistent and proves much better than other sources which are dependent on wind or sun exposure</P>
